**3. Place 3 chests at the Bottom-Left corner as shown below**
(Using bigger modded chests is recommended. The first chest is for fuel, second chest is for seeds, third one is for wheat output)

**6. Put 2 stacks of Seeds in the second chest**
(Can be less. But putting 2 stacks will make sure it will plant seeds in every farm land in the farm)

**7. (Optinal) Place a Glowstone block above the water to help wheat grow at night**

also if the farm is in a snowy biome this can help to stop it from freezing

```
pastebin run Vg8AEmt3 installer.lua
```

**5. The turtle will start working. Now you don't need to do anything else, just check on it every now and then and check the amount of coal and fuel left.**
**You can check the wheat output on the third chest. Sometimes the seeds chest may overflow, this will most likely not cause any issues, but you can empty some of it**
